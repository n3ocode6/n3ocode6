### 🧩 **Coding Philosophy**  
- **Consistency is key**: Small steps every day to improve and learn new things.  
- **Learning by building**: I learn best by working on projects and solving real problems.  
- **Problem-solving**: I focus on understanding how to break down problems before jumping into code.  
- **Don’t fear failure**: Bugs and errors are just stepping stones to learning.  
- **Code like it’s the last time**: Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
